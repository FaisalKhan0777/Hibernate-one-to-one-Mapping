# Hibernate-one-to-one-Mapping
I implemented a One-to-One Mapping between Aadhar and Person entities using Hibernate in Java! This project is a testament to the power of ORM frameworks in simplifying database interactions and managing complex relationships effectively.

# ðŸš€ Key Highlights:
âœ… Designed a robust database schema to map Aadhar and Person entities with a one-to-one relationship.
âœ… Utilized DAO (Data Access Object) for seamless data operations.
âœ… Built a RESTful Controller layer to handle HTTP requests and ensure efficient communication.
âœ… Incorporated DTO (Data Transfer Object) for secure and efficient data transfer between layers.

 # ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
Java
Hibernate ORM
MySQL (Database)

# ðŸŒŸ Learning Outcomes:
Gained hands-on experience in ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) with Hibernate.
Enhanced understanding of RESTful API design and implementation.
Improved skills in layering architecture with DAO, DTO, and Controller patterns.
This project reflects my passion for building scalable and efficient backend systems while adhering to best practices in software development. Looking forward to applying these skills to solve real-world challenges!
